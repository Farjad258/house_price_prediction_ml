# House Price Prediction 🏠
A beginner-friendly AI project to predict house prices using Python and a trained machine learning model.

---

## *Project Overview*
This project predicts house prices based on input features like location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.  
It demonstrates how to build a machine learning model, save it, and make predictions using Python — perfect for beginners following a step-by-step workflow.

---

## *Problem Statement*
Predicting house prices helps buyers and sellers understand market trends and make informed decisions.  
This project solves:
- Estimating house prices given key features
- Learning basic ML workflow: data → model → prediction

---

## *Tech Stack*
- Python 3.x  
- scikit-learn  
- pandas, numpy  

---

## *How It Works*
1. *Input Features*  
   Users provide key information about the house via main.py.  
   Example features: Number of Bedrooms, Area (sq.ft), Location  

2. *Model Loading*  
   The pre-trained model is saved as model.pkl and loaded automatically by main.py.  

3. *Prediction*  
   Run the script:
```bash
python main.py

## *How to Run Locally*
1. *Clone the repository*
   git clone (https://github.com/Farjad258/house_price_prediction_ml.git)
   cd house-price-prediction

2. *Install Dependencies*
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. *Run the Prediction Script*
    python main.py

4. *Enter house features and get the predicted price*


## *Deployment*
   > Deployment on Render/Streamlit is in progress.
   > The project can be run locally using the instructions above.

## *Key Learnings*
1. Learned how to train a machine learning model from scratch
2. Built a complete house price prediction workflow
3. Practiced running predictions with Python scripts

## *Project Files*
1. main.py – Script to make predictions
2. model.pkl – Pre-trained house price prediction model
3. requirements.txt – Python libraries required
